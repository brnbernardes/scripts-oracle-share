/*
For tablespaces with autoextend enabled, the script calculates the maximum sizes and percentages based on maximum size the datafiles can grow to,
but the "FREE_MB" column is based on the current file size, so use that figure for tablespaces with datafiles set to autoextend.
If we switch off autoextend for the relevant datafile, the last four columns will look more representative.
